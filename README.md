# Accedo Programming Test

This is a Media App VOD to test some technologys know-hows.

## How and why

I choose code the front-end with Reactjs because it is a javascript framework reference and worldwide used, and this application has front-end focus, but dont suggest any another. On the other hand, the back-end I choose do at a PHP's _vanilla style_ with a simple (almost) MVC structure because it's supposed to be easy to install, and this project does not require some huge like a Laravel, but the core of this can be converted easily if necessary.
